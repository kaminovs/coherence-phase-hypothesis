# The Coherence Phase Hypothesis

This repository contains the reference implementation and reproducible
experiments for the paper:

**“The Coherence Phase Hypothesis: Empirical Evidence From Competitive
Cellular Automata”**

## Overview
We study competitive agents in an extended Conway’s Game of Life
environment and demonstrate that long-term dominance and viability
emerge only within a bounded coherence phase window.

## Reproducibility
All stochasticity is controlled by fixed random seeds.
Only the Blue agent’s temperature parameter varies across conditions.
